The goal of CVD Prevent is to provide an R wrapper to the CVD Prevent [application programming interface](https://www.cvdprevent.nhs.uk/home) (API). Users can make API requests through built-in R functions.

The Cardiovascular Disease Prevention Audit (CVDPREVENT) is an England-wide primary care audit that automatically extracts routinely held GP data. The Data & Improvement Tool provides open access to the data, with clear, actionable insights for those tasked with improving cardiovascular health.
